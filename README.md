# Battle of the Bulge

This is a website with basic information covering the battle of the bulge also known as the Ardennes Offensive, which was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. The battle lasted from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe.

This is where the idea for Battle of the Bulge comes from. An educational need to provide basic information for anyone who is unfamilar with the battle and historical facts surrounding this event.

People can use the Battle of the Bulge to find historical information such as where it took place, who was involved. Users will also be able to navigate away from the Home page, to a gallery of fun pictures, and then to a timeline page to get even more information on the timeline of events.
